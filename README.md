# notemate
Quick notetaking tool for Pebble Time

Idea is to let user dictate short items (<100 chars) which are sent to some remote server which then handles further processing.
User interface should be only a single click to start and single click to approve note. App should quit after successfull note sending so interference to normal watch operation and battery lifetime is minimal.

Server communication is handled with PebbleKit JS so no phone applications needed

**TODO**

* Configuration for server url
* Remove extra clicks
* Icon for app
* Fancier graphics
